This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Starter Next.js with React Three Fiber (r3f)

Basic starter for Next.js projects with React Three Fiber for 3D web experiences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KiryanAlpha/starter-next-r3f-basic.git
cd starter-next-r3f-basic


2. Install dependencies:

npm install

(This will automatically install three, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, and all other required packages from package.json.)

3. Run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
